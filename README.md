# Xinha4Ryuzine

### Important

Do NOT replace the standard Xinha editor with Xinha4Ryuzine.  Xinha4Ryuzine no longer functions as a stand-alone editor as some items in the core javascript now expect the editor to be embedded in a page containing elements with specific IDs.

### Plugins

Xinha4Ryuzine includes some Ryuzine-specific plugins:

+ RyuButtons - adds Ryuzine-specific buttons to the toolbar
+ RYUMasterStyles - based on “Stylist” with some functions offloaded to Writer. 
+ RYUStylist - based on “Stylist” with some functions offloaded to Writer.
+ RYUPageManager - original plugin, only works in Ryuzine Writer, expects specific format.
+ RYUPicker - based on “CSSPicker,” some items open and retrieve data from Ryuzine Writer dialogs, not Xinha dialogs.
+ RYUFileManager - modified “Extended File Manager” plugin, now opens in a Ryuzine Dialog instead of a pop-up window.
